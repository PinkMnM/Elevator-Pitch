# Elevator-Pitch



Hi my name is Michael Gore and I am a Junior Developer currently enrolled at Springboard in the Software Engineering course and, I am projected to graduate in December of 2023. Through previous employment and further education I have refined my skills in problem solving, self motivation, and teamwork. I've also gained experience using programming languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS as well as using GIT and working with the terminal. I've also completed projects such as the memory game using Javascript and HTML along with CSS for the animation effects and layouts. Long term I plan to receive my certificate of completion from Springboard and pursue a career in software engineering. Iâ€™m grateful for this time to gain further connections as I move forward in my career entering the Tech Industry.
